# Competetive-Programming

Here I started tracking my progress in competetive programming.
There're some information about what I use everyday.

## Usefil links for practise
 I attached my profiles to some links.

* [Codeforces main](https://codeforces.com/profile/ZzZZzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz), [Codeforces alt](https://codeforces.com/profile/supermegaultraepichacker) - contests, a good way of practicing.

* [A2oj](https://a2oj.com/profile?Username=One_Submission_Man) - Div2 E ladders are good.

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Zhanbolat) - Diverse problems, good editorials. Just great.

* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/z_programmist)  I used to write Long challenges regularly. Usually half of the problems are more basic and well-known. Don't know if you can learn from there much, but still worth for contesting.

* [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/z-programmist/)
Topcoder's problems have more concept, thinking and less implementation.

* [Atcoder](http://atcoder.jp/user/Zhanbolat) - more demand on problem solving and mathematical thinking.

* [Csacademy](https://csacademy.com/user/supermegaultraepichacker)

* [Aizu Online Judge](http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/user.jsp?id=Zhanbolat#1)
- Japanese online judge, some problems are transltated to english, for japanese I use translator and it works for me.


* [AOJ](http://aoj-icpc.ichyo.jp/?aoj_rivals=&sort2_order=desc&year_max=&source4=1&aoj_username=Zhanbolat&point_max=1200&sort1_order=asc&source2=1&source3=1&source1=1&point_min=100&sort2_by=num_aoj_acceptances&year_min=&sort1_by=point)
- Japanese ACM ICPC collection problems for ractise for ACM ICPC.

* [Problem Topics (Morass)](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55274) - collection of problems for a particular topics.
* [Rating Tutorial from E8jkewjrlkj](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53341)

## Editors

* Sublime Text
    - [FastOlympCoding](https://github.com/Jatana/FastOlympicCoding) - plugin for running and testing
    - Maybe the best for text editing but haven't used for this purpose.

* Far manager
    - The best working environment, because files are more easily accessed than on other text editors, embeded command line also makes life easier.
    
* Visual Studio Code
     - Has terminal, but if I will be able to configure maybe I will switch to it.

* Visual Studio
    - Basically for creating .NET applications, good for OOP
