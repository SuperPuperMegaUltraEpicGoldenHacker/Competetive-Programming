Here I started tracking my progress in competetive programming.
There're some information about what I use everyday for practise.

Long contest - I used to write them regularly. Usually half of the problems are more basic, and most of them are not original, mostly I saw them from Codeforces, but I think 

[Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/z-programmist/)
People on CF community advised. The problems have more concept, thinking and less implementation.

 - contests are good, so I write regularly
