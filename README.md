# Competetive-Programming

Here I started tracking my progress in competetive programming.

There're some information about what I use to do everyday for practise.

## Usefil links for practise
 I attached my profiles to some links.

<<<<<<< HEAD
* [Codeforces](codeforces.com) - The best platform for competitive programming, the great commmunity is here. From time to time I like to read blogs, tutorials and stay tuned for events. 
    [Codeforces main](https://codeforces.com/profile/ZzZZzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz), [Codeforces alt](https://codeforces.com/profile/supermegaultraepichacker)

* [A2oj](https://a2oj.com/profile?Username=One_Submission_Man) - when I want to practice particular topic like dp or math, I usually go to search on Problems Category. 
  - Ladders - I recommend div2E ladder. I've solved ~30 on div2E and ~20 on div1D, ~30 on div1E.

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Zhanbolat) - they provide one of the best contests I believe. They were not hosting new contests recent years.

* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/z_programmist) - Long contest - I used to write them regularly. Usually half of the problems are more basic, and most of them are not original, good to solve if you've met them for the first time.

* [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/z-programmist/) - The problems have more concept, thinking and less implementation. The good place to improve your problem-solving and thinking.

* [Atcoder](http://atcoder.jp/user/Zhanbolat) - contests are considered to be high quality, also I write them regularly.
=======
* [Codeforces main](https://codeforces.com/profile/ZzZZzzzZZZZZzzzzzzzz), [Codeforces alt](https://codeforces.com/profile/supermegaultraepichacker) - contests, a good way of practicing.

* [A2oj](https://a2oj.com/profile?Username=One_Submission_Man) - Div2 E ladders are good.

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Zhanbolat) - Diverse problems, good editorials. Just great.

* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/z_programmist)  I used to write Long challenges regularly. Usually half of the problems are more basic and well-known. Don't know if you can learn from there much, but still worth for contesting.

* [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/members/z-programmist/)
Topcoder's problems have more concept, thinking and less implementation.

* [Atcoder](http://atcoder.jp/user/Zhanbolat) - more demand on problem solving and mathematical thinking.

* [Csacademy](https://csacademy.com/user/supermegaultraepichacker) - good platform from Romania.

* [Aizu Online Judge](http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/user.jsp?id=Zhanbolat#1) - Japanese online judge, some problems are transltated to english, for japanese I use google-translator and it works.

  * I write contets on C++. 
  * use cmd scripting - batch/bash

## Coding editors

## Editors
>>>>>>> 6a12cca6db67e1ae4b1cb0f53c7a0a4100e29b2c

* Sublime Text
    - [FastOlympCoding](https://github.com/Jatana/FastOlympicCoding) - plugin for running and testing
    - Maybe the best for text editing but haven't used for this purpose.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Have snippets, which is very usable in competeive programming.

* Far manager
    - The best working environment, because files are more easily accessed than on other text editors, embeded command line also makes life easier.
    - design is not good as wished. Doesn't really matter to me while coding.
    
* Visual Studio Code
     - Has terminal
     - Has many features like Far manager.
     - Right now one of my choices for coding and text editing stuff like Markdown. 

* Visual Studio
    - Basically for creating Windows (.NET) applications
    - I found desginer to be very handy while creating Windows Form applications.

* Visual Studio Code
     - Has terminal, but if I will be able to configure maybe I will switch to it.

* Visual Studio
    - Basically for creating .NET applications, good for OOP
